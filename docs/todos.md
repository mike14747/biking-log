Figure out a data storage solution (mongodb, sanity or some free sql db???). For now I'm going to continue with a local MySQL database in hopes of using mariaDB on AWS.

Make a favicon and add it to document.js

Add next-auth

Style the Header and Footer

Should the auth system use email or username? I'm leaning toward using email since I'd like to learn how to implement it.

Make a test account so others can log into it and test the app
