Find a SQL server to use with this app... maybe mariaDB on AWS?

Make a favicon and add it to document.js

Add next-auth

Style the Header and Footer

Should the auth system use email or username? I'm leaning toward using email since I'd like to learn how to implement it. Now I'm leaning back toward username.

Instead of making a test account so others can log into it and test the app, add the ability to register a new user

Add login and register pages
