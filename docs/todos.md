Find a SQL server to use with this app... maybe mariaDB on AWS?

Make a favicon and add it to document.js

Add next-auth (it's been added but needs more testing)

Style the Header and Footer

Should the auth system use email or username? I'm leaning toward using email since I'd like to learn how to implement it. Now I'm leaning back toward username.

Add login and register pages (both have been added, but need more testing)
